## GitHub mute notifications

Extension that mute the GitHub notifications icon ðŸ”‡

### Why?

When you are using a tool like [Octobox](https://octobox.io) for managing your GitHub notifications, you still need to enable the ["Web" notifications](https://github.com/settings/notifications). So every time you navigate on GitHub you will see this little bubble that inform you that you have new notifications.

I don't want to be distract by this little bubble ðŸ™ˆ
